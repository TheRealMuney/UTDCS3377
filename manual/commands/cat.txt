This is a very basic command that allows you to be able to see the output of a file without opening it

This is often used with different operators (which can be found in the operators file)

Example: cat text.txt

Some important info:

-n : This option displays the contents of a file with line numbers.

-b : This option displays the contents of a file with line numbers, but only for non-blank lines.

-E : This option displays a dollar sign ($) at the end of each line, indicating the end of the line.

-T : This option displays tab characters as ^I.

-s : This option squeezes multiple blank lines into a single blank line.

-v : This option displays non-printable characters as ^X or M-^X (where X is a letter or number).

-u : This option disables output buffering, displaying the contents of a file immediately as they are read.

-A : This option displays all characters, including control characters and special characters, with non-printable characters displayed in a visible form.

-q : This option suppresses the display of non-printable characters, displaying them as question marks instead.

-r : This option displays the contents of a file in reverse order, starting with the last line and ending with the first.
