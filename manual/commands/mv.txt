This is a basic command that allows you to be able to move a file somewhere else

This can also be used to rename a file without changing the contents

Examples: mv this.txt that.txt - rename
	  mv this.txt ~dir/dir2/ - move

Some important info:

-i: This option prompts before overwriting any existing files. This is useful if you want to avoid accidentally overwriting any files.

-v: This option enables verbose mode, displaying each file as it is moved or renamed.

-u: This option only moves a file if the source file is newer than the destination file, or if the destination file does not exist.

-n: This option prevents overwriting existing files and instead keeps the original file as is.

-t: This option allows you to specify the target directory for the moved files.

--backup: This option creates a backup copy of the original file before overwriting it.

--suffix=SUFFIX: This option allows you to specify a suffix to add to the backup file.

--version-control: This option creates a numbered backup of the original file, rather than just a single backup copy.

-f: This option forces the move or rename, even if it would overwrite existing files or cause other errors.
