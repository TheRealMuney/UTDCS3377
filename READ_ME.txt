Hello, World!

In the manual folder you will find the following two folders:

	In the operators folder, you will find a tect file for each operator.
	In the commands folder, you will find a text file for each command.

	The goal is to be more digestible and  with examples eliminating the manual.

In the how folder you will find an explain.txt folder explaining the parent folder topic
ex: how/compile/explain -> explains how to compile c++ code

In the tests folder you will find test files to learn commands; essentially they are examples

-> foo: work in progress tests, should be empty unless currently testing a command/issue
-> mTest: example of a makefile
-> practice: example of a simple .txt file to be used for exploring outputs, using >>, >, etc.
-> fork: example of how a fork works with pid

In the assg folder you will find the assignments for CS 3377 @ University of Texas at Dallas - Dr. Mohamed Amine Belkoura

DISCLAIMER: These are not the entire assignment, and this is as of the Spring 2023 semester
	DO NOT USE THESE TO CHEAT, USE THEM AS A REFERENCE TO LEARN

Bye, World!
