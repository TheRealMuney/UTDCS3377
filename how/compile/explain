To compile c++ code follow these steps:

1. make cpp files
2. g++ -c filename1.cpp filename2.cpp etc.cpp
3. g++ -o output.exe filename1.o filename2.o etc.o
4. ./output.exe

To explain:
1. This step is where the coding is done; nothing special to be done when creating these using vi codename
2. The g++ -c means to only compile the following files, and not link
3. The g++ -o means to link the output of these files to the following names 
4. This excutes the code linked

To create a Makefile for these:
1. vi Makefile
2. Include the commands to be executed by the makefile -> similar to 1-4 above including dependencies and clean
3. make

clean -> this deletes all of the .o files, thus clearing the outputs, while keeping the .cpp files for the original code
dependencies -> if the execution of the command depends on a file or the execution of another command, include a : depend
(replace depend with the file name -> hello.o example.o etc.o would check makefile for these commands first and run those)
